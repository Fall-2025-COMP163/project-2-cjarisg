Character Abilities Showcase
COMP 163 – Project 2
Author: Clayan Ariaga
Date: 11/07/2025
Overview
This project demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, and composition using a
simple RPG-style character system. It includes six classes:
- Character (base class)
- Player (base player class)
- Warrior
- Mage
- Rogue
- Weapon
The provided SimpleBattle class is used to test character interactions.
Bonus Creative Features
1. Critical Hit System for the Rogue
Rogue’s basic attack includes a probability for critical strikes, doubling damage.
2. Special Ability Moves
Each player subclass has a unique special attack:
- Warrior: power_strike()
- Mage: fireball()
- Rogue: sneak_attack()
3. Weapon Composition Class
A separate Weapon class demonstrates composition and prints weapon statistics.
